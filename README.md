# password-generator

This is a random password generator built with javascript that uses user input from different prompts to display a secure password that contains, numbers, letters both upper and lowercase, and special characters.

Using a series of prompts, the parameters of the password are validated with a series of "if" statements.

When all of the selected prompts have been validated the password variable is ran through a for loop to generate the desired password.
